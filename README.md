# Steffy DB Plugin [reimagined]

## Why?

With v1.x we encountered some limitation with TypeORM, where we needed to fallback on Low-Level API, thus removing our initial goal to have a generic use.

## How?

Well... same as every... rewrite from scratch.

## Compatibility

Planned compatibility is the same as the old plugin. Here you will have the chance to follow our progress as we progress.

* [-] MongoDB
* [ ] Postgres
* [ ] MySQL/MariaDB
* [ ] MSSQL
* [ ] Oracle

We will start with the reimplementation of the MongoDB compatibility, and progress further from there.
